Part of MBA theisis dissertationg: Labour Management - Nurse rostering optimization for an oncology clinin using Integer Programming and Java with CPLEX library:

The current thesis is a presentation, analysis and solution of the rostering optimization problem faced by the oncology clinic of Papageorgiou Hospital of Thessaloniki. 
The problem that arises is an Integer Programming problem. In this scheduling problem, there is an imbalance in the number and type of shifts (morning, noon, evening) 
that is covered by the human resources of the clinic. 
The thesis aims at solving the problem by finding a balance in the number of shifts covered by the oncologyâ€™s department nurses and the specific part of the day that they cover. 
After a brief literature review, the problem is presented and modeled. What is more, Java programming is used for finding the optimized solution, along with IBM's Cplex program, 
through a Java library, Iloplex. The main reason that this thesis was created, is to clearly present to the reader how a real-life case study at a Greek Hospital can hide 
operational research problems and how these problems can be modeled and solved. The above-mentioned problem has been solved twice. 
The first solution was made using all the constraints from the description provided by the clinic staff while the second by relaxing some constraints, 
analyzing the changes in the solution.
